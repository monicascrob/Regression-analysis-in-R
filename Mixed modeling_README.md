# Regression-analysis-in-R
Mixed modeling homework for the R course as part of the People Analytics Certificate at NYU.

Tasks covered:
- Importing a new dataset in R
- Setting a seed and performing train/test split of the dataset
- Calculating the AIC, Pseudo R^2
- Calculating the confusion matrix accuracy and the AUC
- Adding variables to create more complex models
- Creating a new variable to break potential multicollinearity and comparing inferential statistics between the old and new model (that includes the new variable)
- Crafting K-means cluster sets and adding a new cluster to the training set as a new variable, further using it to create a new model
